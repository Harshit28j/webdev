<H1>DAYALBAGH EDUCATIONAL ISNTITUTE</H1><BR>
<P>The Dayalbagh Educational Institute is located amidst the tranquil environs of Dayalbagh, a self-contained colony renowned for its serene environment and secular 
establishments, in which its inhabitants lead an active, disciplined and co-operative community life dedicated to service, conforming to the high spiritual ideals of their faith. 
On the outskirts of the historic city of Agra, the campus is situated in garden settings, away from the din and noise of the city. Nestled between lush green fields, 
it provides an excellent ambience and academic setting which is in harmony with nature. This, along with a simple, disciplined and principled life, undoubtedly contributes to 
the strength of the social, moral and spiritual fiber of the institute's educational system.
