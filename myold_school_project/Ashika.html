<P> Boston Public School is located at Bodla Road, Dehtora, Sikandra. It is a Co-Educational Secondary School institution affiliated to the CBSE. It has been established to
cater to the rising demand for quality education in Agra. The School has a proactive approach to education and
its foundations are based on the philosophy that quality education requires consistent efforts and new directions in the area of teaching and learning. 
It is the endeavour of the school to be student centered in its approach and provide a balanced curriculum that results in the development of the overall personality of
the students and to help them in becoming thought leaders of tomorrow. The school has qualified faculty to help in creation of new knowledge which can be translated
 into classroom teaching.Classrooms are spacious, centrally air conditioned and have lighting arrangements as per international standards.
 We ensure our students get classrooms that are not only spacious and airy, but also subject based. The number of students in each class is restricted,
 so that the teachers give individual attention to each student.</P>
